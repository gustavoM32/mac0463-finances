# Financial management app

A financial management prototype app made for the Mobile Computing (MAC5743) class. The interface is based on [
Afrills' design](https://dribbble.com/shots/14363799-DOMPET-Q-Financial-Management-App).

A file .env should be created in the project  root folder with the following content:
```
WEATHER_API_KEY=API_KEY
```
where API_KEY is the key from the [OpenWeather](
https://home.openweathermap.org/) website.

There is also an Android Studio version of this app [here](https://github.com/gustavoM32/mac0463-finances-2) (with some different features).
